title: The new rules of digital marketing
---

How can digital marketers co-ordinate content and data across fragmented systems?

“Multichannel marketing at its most complex includes automation, personalisation, attribution and resolution or transaction across every marketing and communications channel.” - _[The Reality of Multichannel Marketing](https://econsultancy.com/reports/the-reality-of-multichannel-marketing)_, Econsultancy

## Single view, not single place

Online channels are hungry: as they grow they generate more data. The temptation to hold onto it is too great to resist.

This creates a headache for digital marketers. A common situation is to find customer data split across many different systems: website content management systems, email marketing systems, social management platforms and search platforms - in addition to multiple internal CRMs and other data stores.

These systems are in many cases managed by different internal teams which makes integration hard. And platform providers don’t help since they prefer lock-in, so are incentivised to keep their data within their platform.

The dream of a single _store_ for customer data cannot survive in this environment. Instead a more fruitful approach is to strive for unified _views_ of customer data, using services that aggregate data from many stores (such as [Funnelback](https://www.funnelback.com)). Digital marketers can set rules to determine how data from different stores is displayed alongside each other.

## Content lives everywhere
Content lives in multiples places, not just the website. Social platforms demand native upload for the best performance. Mobile publishing, such as [Facebook Instant articles](https://instantarticles.fb.com) and [Google AMP](https://www.ampproject.org), require new content formats. And content might live in other ancillary services too, like optimisation services (e.g. [Optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com)) or scheduling systems (e.g. [Buffer](https://buffer.com)). 

The demand for native upload will only increase as platform providers become more fragmented and more needy.

The dream of a _single place_ where all content lives and is published cannot survive in this environment. Instead a more fruitful approach is to hold content in a system designed to present it in different formats and publish over APIs (e.g. [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com)). Digital marketers can then set rules to determine how content is sent to different platforms.

## Analytics on every platform
Every platform includes analytics and this is creating new, more powerful ways of profiling users and marketing to them such as:

* _Segmentation and personalisation_ - serving more relevant content based on knowledge of attributes, behaviours and preferences
* _Remarketing and matches_ - creating more opportunities to interact based on past behaviour
* _Lookalike audiences_ - finding new people to target based on their similarity to existing customers

Each of these tactics could potentially be used on any channel/platform: on every website, email, social platform and search platform. Not just within each one, but between them too.

The dream of a _single marketing system_ where all analytics live and marketing decisions are made cannot survive in this environment. Instead a more fruitful approach is to integrate software bilaterally, tying the APIs of many systems together using a rules platform (e.g. [Zapier](https://zapier.com)). Digital marketers can then set rules to determine what marketing decisions are made based on analytics on disparate platforms.
