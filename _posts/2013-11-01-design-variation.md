[The New York Times' Snow Fall article](http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/) has successfully set a vision for what online communication can be - as is evidenced by the amount people are still talking about it online and at meetups.

The Guardian had their own take on it with [Firestorm](http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/may/26/firestorm-bushfire-dunalley-holmes-family) and usvsth3m have even produced a parody (the ultimate compliment) with [Icefail](http://toys.usvsth3m.com/icefail/).

Snow Fall and Firestorm are meant to be immersive experiences. Regardless of whether their goal is wholly achieved, they do show the power of considering design in tandem with content.
