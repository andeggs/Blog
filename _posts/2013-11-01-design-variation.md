It's interesting to see the effects of the [New York Times' Snow Fall article](http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/) still reverberating around.

The Guardian had their own take on it with [Firestorm](http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/may/26/firestorm-bushfire-dunalley-holmes-family) and usvsth3m even produced a parody of the genre with [Icefail](http://toys.usvsth3m.com/icefail/).
