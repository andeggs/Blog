[The New York Times' Snow Fall article](http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/) continues to be [talked about online](http://martinbelam.com/2013/newsrewired_breaking_articles/) and at meetups.

The Guardian had their own take on the style with [Firestorm](http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/may/26/firestorm-bushfire-dunalley-holmes-family) and usvsth3m have even produced a parody (the ultimate compliment) with [Icefail](http://toys.usvsth3m.com/icefail/).

Snow Fall and Firestorm are meant to be immersive experiences. Regardless of whether their goal is wholly achieved, they do show the power of considering design in tandem with content.

What's interesting is actually not whether their particular mix of longform text, full-screen imagery and HD video is exactly right but instead whether web content as a whole is too uniform.

Very few articles have design variation
