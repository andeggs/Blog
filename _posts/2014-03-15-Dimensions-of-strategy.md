Should all digital strategies be the same?

It seems that many of the debates about strategy come down to where one stands on the following four questions:

- _Stand-alone vs. embedded_: Is there a separate ‘digital strategy’ document or is the approach instead embedded in other strategy documents?
- _Instructive vs. emergent_: Is the approach ‘top-down’ or does it emphasise fostering innovation so that solutions emerge ‘bottom-up’?
- _Centralised vs. decentralised_: Is control exerted by specifying individual’s roles or by enforcing rules, standards and processes?
- _Iterative vs disruptive_: Is the approach one of changing the present or breaking with the past?

The choices are inevitably as much a reflection of one’s personal values, intellectual paradigms and preferred styles of working as what is likely to be most effective for the organisation at that point in time.
