Every now and again I like to dip back into coding. Nothing else has that strange combination of intense frustration, when the bugs refuse to be squashed, and deep satisfaction, when what was once an idea becomes a stilt-walking reality.

My latest project is [ProSocial, a free WordPress plugin](http://digitalshift.me/prosocial/).

It shows a pop-up bar next to blog authors' names, with links to their social media accounts. Hopefully it will be a useful way for owners of multi-author blogs to connect their readers with their writers.

Although it's on a much smaller scale, ProSocial draws inspiration from a host of exciting products that connect people's dispersed (and often fragmented) digital identities: [iftt](http://ifttt.com/), [flavors.me](http://flavors.me/), [hojoki](http://hojoki.com/).

As people spread their digital lives about, it seems to me that there is an increasing need for services that bring them back together again.

ProSocial will be in the WordPress plugin directory shortly.
Let me know what you think!
