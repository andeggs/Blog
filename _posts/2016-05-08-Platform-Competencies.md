title: Platform competencies
---

This [excellent article](http://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Where-next-for-UK-government-as-a-platform) by Mark Thompson from 2015 sets out the definition of a 'digital business' as one that is specifically configured to exploit shared internet-based infrastructureâ€™s unique ability to:

1. consolidate consumers into platforms of demand;
2. simplify supply and value chains; and
3. readily enable a much wider and plural supply base producing ecosystems of supply.

Sangeet Paul Choudary's book [Platform Scale](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Platform-Scale-emerging-business-investment/dp/9810967586) explains the difference between 'Pipe' business models and 'Platform' business models:

* Pipes create value through processes that co-ordinate internal labour and resource towards efficient delivery of value to aggregated consumers.
* Platforms orchestrate value-exchanging interactions in their ecosystems using data about the participant.

The transition from pipes to platforms requires a shift in thinking:

1. Markets: Consumers to Producers
2. Competitive advantage: Resources to Ecosystems
3. Value creation: Processes to Interactions

And interestingly he argues that platforms need _interaction-first thinking_, above user-first thinking

## Competencies
A whole host of new skills and functions are needed to establish and grow a platform.

### Market making

* Standards: Define services in common ways to enable the market to operate.
* Quality: Make the quality of each service transparent, whether that is determined centrally or through the community
* Personalisation: Tailor each participants' experience to ensure they are served the most relevant services from a large market
* Matching: Match supply with demand using data and algorithms
* Ecosystem: Enable an ecosystem of ancillary services through plug and play architecture

### Growth

* Marketing: Attract both producers and consumers to the platform
* Virality: Design the platform to enable organic sharing with others
* Lock in: Enable the build up of cumulative value such as reputation, influence, collections or learning filters

### Behaviour and culture

* Governance: Establish rules and decision-making procedures
* Culture: Set community norms such as through moderation and curation
* Behaviour: Reward desirable behaviour such as through UX or using friction
* Feedback: Facilitate feedback from consumers to producers
* Empowerment: Train and support market participants and devolve governance roles to them
