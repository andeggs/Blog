I'm beginning to realise that there's something special about writing.

Writing is the moment at which one has to formalise one's thoughts, as hazy notions are distilled into clear ideas. It's the moment at which one can no longer bluff oneself nor allow contradictions to coexist.

Best of all, it's the point of clarity â€“ at which the writer can find out what they thought all along.

_So I want to blog more_.

To do that I need to schedule it, otherwise it just won't happen. I'm going to aim to blog every Friday morning from now on.
