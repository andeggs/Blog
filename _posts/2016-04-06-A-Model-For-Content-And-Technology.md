title: A model for content and technology
---

To configure an organisationâ€™s content and technology for maximum benefit, you need to know what the options are. This blog describes a model for content and technology options in terms of Sources, Platforms, Relevance, Automation and Engagement.

## Sources
Content may be sourced manually or automatically. Once created it adds to a bank of content which can be reused:

* User-generated: created by users themselves
* Curated: aggregated from other sources and curated
* Produced: produced in-house or commissioned externally

## Platforms
Content may be published to different platforms (social, email, websites, apps, ads):

* Native: content added to third-party platforms is likely to be optimised for discovery and promoted/boosted
* Proprietary: content added to owned platforms is likely to be optimised for search and follow-on actions
* Syndicates: content syndicated through deals, auto-posting or PR is likely to be optimised for referral
* Advertisements: content occupying paid slots is likely to be optimised for clicks

## Relevance
Consumers respond better to content tailored to their attributes, behaviours and preferences.

* Segmentation: tailored for groups of consumers, based on aggregate data
* Personalisation: tailored for an individual consumer, based on their data alone

## Automation
Automation helps to promote content to the right person at the right time on the basis of an event, such as:

* Attributes - such as location, demographics, interests
* Interactions - such as reading, sign up, abandonment
* Events - such as weather, holidays, news

## Engagement
Users may engage with the content in a number of ways:

* Subscribed to email or social channels
* Shared on social media
* Linked from their site
* Commented on the post
* Cookied and so available for remarketing
