title: Talking policy
---

I've been thinking about how to help policy teams make better use of the web.
Here are some messaging styles that could be applied to policy outputs:

- **Immersive**: The [dangers of fracking website](http://www.dangersoffracking.com/) is compelling, even though the arguments are debatable.
- **Social**: [Due Diligence](http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/02/help-me-write-this-book.php) was written in the open, incorporating comments from readers.
- **Narrative**: [An unquiet landscape](http://www.stanford.edu/group/ruralwest/cgi-bin/projects/energyvideo/) uses annotated video to take the reader on a journey.
- **Exploratory**: [Gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org/) helps the user to explore the arguments.
- **Inspirational**: [TED talks](http://www.ted.com/talks) persuade and inspire.
