Nobel prize winner [Ronald Coase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Coase) died this week.

His brilliant work explained why firms exist. 

At the time, it wasn't clear why the economy didn't just consist of independent, self-employed people contracting with one another. He showed that there are _transaction costs_ associated with procuring from the market. For instance there are costs involved in searching and selecting a supplier and for enforcing contracts. Sometimes these costs are so high that it makes more sense for a firm to internalise the production of the service themselves.

I think something similar is at work in software.
